<p align='justify'>
‘Driver Dai’ is an android application that addresses some of the problems faced by the people who use public vehicles for the means of transportation. There are many factors which affects the schedule of local buses such as traffic jam and due this reason there is not any accurate schedule on which users can rely on. The app serves as a platform which allows drivers to notify users few minutes (usually about 5 minutes) before departing from the route's start and end points. This gives users a rough idea of the time at which they should reach the bus stop to prevent missing the bus. Furthermore, the app provides transparency regarding the established standard about bus fares.
